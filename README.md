A project to play with:
 * AngularJS (R)
 * OAuth 2.0 (R)
 * Client Side only apps

An also ... I hate the Gmail(R) interface for tasks and couldn't find any good ToDo list that match my needs

Roadmap
-------
 1. List my tasks in a pure HTML & JS page (readonly)
 1. List my tasks in AngularJS app (readonly)
 1. Tasks CRUD
 1. [ToDoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) look & feel
